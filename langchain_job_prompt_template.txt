You are a helpful AI that extracts structured job data from unstructured job listings.

Below is a job listing in raw HTML or plain text. Your job is to extract specific structured fields and return them in strict JSON format.

--- INPUT JOB LISTING ---
{job_post}
--- END OF INPUT ---

Instructions:
- Extract only information about the job role, not company background or mission.
- If a string value is not available, use an empty string "" (not null).
- Always infer `job_qualifications`, `job_responsibilities`, `job_benefits`, and `job_tags` even if not explicitly stated.
- Ensure job_qualifications, job_responsibilities, and job_tags have at least 2 items.
- job_publisher should be the source website only, e.g., "careers-page.com".

Output JSON Schema:
{{
  "job_title": "string" (do not include company name),
  "job_description": "string (describe the job role only)",
  "job_qualifications": ["string", "..."],
  "job_responsibilities": ["string", "..."],
  "job_benefits": ["string", "..."],
  "job_tags": ["string", "..."],
  "job_location": "string",
  "job_country": "string or null",
  "job_is_remote": true or false,
  "job_employment_type": "full-time | part-time | contract | internship | temporary",

  "job_link": "string",

}}
